Mention what are the HTTP methods supported by REST?

HTTP methods supported by REST are:

GET: It requests a resource at the request URL. It should not contain a request body as it will be discarded. Maybe it can be cached locally or on the server.
POST: It submits information to the service for processing; it should typically return the modified or new resource
PUT: At the request URL it update the resource
DELETE: At the request URL it removes the resource
OPTIONS: It indicates which techniques are supported
HEAD: About the request URL it returns meta information
